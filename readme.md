## STFGNN-Pytorch

This is the pytorch re-implement of the STFGNN model described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09641.

### Quick start

Put your data in <u>**STFGNN/raw_data**.</u> 

For example, if you want to run model on dataset PEMS03, put the file **<u>adj_mx.pkl</u>** and file <u>**PEMS03.npz**</u> in **<u>STFGNN/raw_data/PEMS03/</u>** .

Set appropriate value of parameter in **<u>STFGNN/config/*.json</u>**.

Run <u>**python main.py**</u> to run the model.
